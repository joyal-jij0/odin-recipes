    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the
      weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.

      Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe
      produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few
      ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much
      better than the boxed stuff).
